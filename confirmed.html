    <div class="hi"><h2>A01</h2><div class="hey"><img src="Ao1.webp" class="picture"><p>A01 is a bipedal monster covered with black, goo-like skin with a malnourished abdomen, his ribs bulging through his chest, slender limbs, three long fingers and a thumb on each hand, each tipped with a claw, and digitigrade legs tipped with hoofed feet. He also wears a light grey scarf and has loads of long, needle-like spines on his back. On his face he wears a white mask, mixing the design of a goat and horse skulls; his actual face has large eyes and a smiling mouth full of sharp teeth. On the back of his head there is a large tentacle/horn. A01 starts out with TBA Sprint Speed, 100 Stamina and 45 Damage (could be changed) in their Normal Form, and TBA Sprint Speed, 100 Stamina, and 35 Damage in their Host Form. A01 has a very versatile moveset, ranging from ranged abilities in his Normal form to more aggressive abilities in his Host form, being able to take a player hostage and make himself more powerful. A01 is still in development, meaning his stats and abilities are subject to balance changes prior to his release.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>The Dog</h2><div class="hey"><img src="dog.webp" class="picture"><p>The Dog appears to be a man inside a bulky mascot suit for the game Duck Season; a beagle-like dog with brown fur and dark spots, accented with a white belly, muzzle, and hands - topped with a black tail and ears. The suit has been dirtied, and is splotched with blood. Where its eyes are meant to be, there are instead two empty sockets, filled with glowing red eyes, granting him a darker, more sinister look. The Dog is seen wielding various weapons, including a red video-game blaster, a bloodied knife, and a silver shotgun - all lifted from various places in his source material. There is little known about The Dog's gameplay, besides that he will have 3 movesets,[1] which consists in being able to swap to a zapper, a shotgun and a knife, giving him a different moveset with each weapon. He will most likely have more than 2 abilities, counting that he will be able to switch between weapons.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Artellur</h2><div class="hey"><img src="art.webp" class="picture"><p>Artelurr is a large, fully-white deer-like creature with a build similar to a centaur. It has areas on it's main body where red flesh is exposed, as well as massive blackened hooves. It's upper body has a large indent in the middle to house a human skull, and a large, blackened ribcage. Below this ribcage is a neck pouch with red flesh inside, used to store corpses. It also visibly has massive blackened antlers on each side of it's upper body. It also has a very thin waist. Artelurr is going to be a slow ambush monster, as described by PhoenixFinch.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Slender Man</h2><div class="hey"><img src="Slend.webp" class="picture"><p>Slenderman is an upcoming monster to Pillar Chase 2. He is a tall supernatural being of myth said to induce life-lasting trauma into people who meet him or come searching for his pages. He was originally created by Something Awful forum user Eric Knudsen (Also known as Victor Surge), and has been a pop culture and horror icon ever since, appearing in a multitude of media in various incarnations. Slenderman is a male humanoid wearing a black suit and shoes, paired with a white undershirt and red tie. He completely lacks a face, his entire head being somewhat textured, like the striations in muscle tissue, but otherwise featureless. He has broad shoulders, and large hands with long fingers that lack fingernails. Six smooth, shadowy tendrils extend from his back, three per side.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Gorefield</h2><div class="hey"><img src="gore.webp" class="picture"><p>Form 1 (Default) Gorefield’s default form is an altered version of Garfield, being an overweight green cat with pale green cartoony eyes, a distraught, emotionless expression, and elongated deformation in his face. He also sports two wounds, on the tip of his ear, and at the end of his tail, revealing some bone. It is notable that in this form, he has noticeable dark spots on his fur around his torso, a trait that does not appear to be shared with his other forms (although this may simply be something caused by lighting). Form 2 (Beast) Gorefield’s “Beast” form mostly retains his face, though his pupils are rolled up and he has a large smile full of dull yellow teeth. His body has almost fully transformed, being more of an undistinguishable mass than a cat anymore. The front of its body is split open to reveal some kind of black mass underneath its green fur, and its hands have deformed to become large claws. These claws have their fingers made of the same black mass, and somewhat shaped like sickles. Notably, it seems to resemble a praying mantis, particularly in the stance. Form 3 (Spider) Gorefield’s “Spider” form mostly retains his face like the other forms, though his pupils are much smaller, and he bears a wide grin full of razor-sharp yellow teeth. His entire body is more arachnid-like, with massive legs made out of some kind of black mass holding him up. Nothing else of this model has been shown from the render. In the simplest terms, it’s Garfield’s head on a spider’s body.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Krasue</h2><div class="hey"><img src="krasue.webp" class="picture"><p>Krasue is an upcoming monster to Pillar Chase 2. She originates from Southeast Asian mythology, where she is depicted as the spirit of a cursed woman (sometimes that of a princess), which after a life of sin was reborn as the monster we now know. Different depictions of Krasue have appeared in a variety of tales throughout different countries, though, she's always depicted as having a voracious appetite for blood or rotten food. Though, she gained the majority of her fame from the 2020 release EYES: The Horror Game, in which she takes a nearly identical form as in the original myth. In said game, her origin is different from the mythology, rather being the spirit of a woman abused by the owner of the Mansion a majority of the game takes place in. She was meant to replace Her from the original Pillar Chase, but she might become her own monster</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Suitmations</h2><div class="hey"><img src="suit.webp" class="picture"><p>Suitmations' appearance is reminiscent of Godzilla (specifically the GyakushuGoji design from Godzilla Raids Again), but is distorted and misshapen. It has a disproportionally long neck, laden with porous holes that contain eyes, and a long mouth that extends down the length of its neck - lined with sharp teeth, and made to resemble a zipper. Godzilla's dorsal plates are replaced with jagged branches that jut out of its lower body. It has small arms and thick, stumpy legs, ended with a large, thick, lumpy tail extending from its back. Suitmations who has little to no leaks so far was confirmed to be a monster and confirmed to have a "atomic breath" attack.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>SMILE DOG</h2><div class="hey"><img src="smile.webp" class="picture"><p>Smile Dog is an upcoming Monster to Pillar Chase 2, it is a popular story and icon in the Creepypasta space. Smile Dog is a demonic entity which throughout its depictions has always taken the form of a dog with a large grin filled with humanoid teeth. In the Creepypasta of the same name, which is credited to Michael Lutz, it resides within an image labeled smile.jpg, which incites insanity on anybody who views the image. It usually appears in the form of hallucinations of various degrees to its victims, though most notably it appears in victim's dreams telling them to "Spread the Word", promising freedom from their curse if so is done. It is currently unknown which form Smile Dog will take within Pillar Chase 2, as the creepypasta has seen a variety of depictions during its lifetime. It is most likely that it will resemble the demon-like red image as that is the most popular and original.</p></div></div>

The claws on her feet are black and pointy, above both feet she has purple and pink striped bands, behind her she has a red and striped heart-shaped tail, and she has a woolly texture applied to almost her entire model.

He has one grey, bulging right eye with a glowing white pupil, his left eye is split into two smaller eyes, with the upper one having a red sclera and the lower one having a yellow sclera, and he has a large, skeleton-like mouth with blocky, rotten yellow teeth. His left arm appears to be mechanical, shrouded in some kind of light blue magic or energy, while in his right hand, he carries a golden, key-shaped weapon of some sort with a light blue, pointed tip. we have barely any news/information about the clockwork keeper monster but people have been speculating that he will either be a dev only monster for now or in the works of recode.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Phantoventaor</h2><div class="hey"><img src="phanto.webp" class="picture"><p>The Phantovenator appears as a bipedal, dinosaur with the general body structure of a dromaeosaur (specifically Utahraptor, confirmed by Gojidev) but it has completely translucent skin, revealing a black skeleton underneath, possibly implying its reanimation. It has long, black shiny feathers sticking out of its arms and tail, and has small tufts of feathers on the back of its head and on its upper back/shoulders. It has glowing purple eyes, and its "skin" has a purple hue as well.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Pal Percy</h2><div class="hey"><img src="pal.webp" class="picture"><p>Pal Percy (also known as just Pal) is an upcoming Monster and addition to Pillar Chase 2, originating from the Five Nights at Freddy's inspired game Playtime with Percy as the overarching antagonist, created by FazieFunbear. He is the result of the Percy Poodle animatronic being hijacked by the Pal Percy toy, and the result of caring for it too much. While not explicitly detailed, Pal is the one who controls every animatronic within Playtime with Percy.</p></div></div>

    <div class="hi"><h2>(special) Ultra M</h2><div class="hey"><img src="ultra.webp" class="picture"><p>Ultra M is an unplayable monster who will appear as a spectator in the upcoming 3-Doomsway map[1].

He was created by Marco Antonio and is the final antagonist of the Friday Night Funkin' mod, Mario's Madness, being a fusion between all of the mod's antagonist's ruled over by M. Apperance wise Ultra M takes the form of a giant, proportionally strange, and horrifically twisted version of Mario.
