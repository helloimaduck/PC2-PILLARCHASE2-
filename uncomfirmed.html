    <div class="hi"><h2>Siren Head</h2><div class="hey"><img src="siren.webp" class="picture"><p>Siren Head was an upcoming Monster to Pillar Chase 2. It is a slender, 12 meter tall humanoid creature named for its head resembling a pair of sirens, who preys on humans it lures with the sounds it makes. It was created by Canadian artist Trevor Henderson (AKA: SlimySwampGhost). He eventually got scrapped since Trevor doesn't allow his creations in games anymore. Siren Head is an immense, skeletal humanoid entity with dry, mummified and darkly-colored skin covering it, incredibly long arms and legs, and a tall, cone-shaped trunk making up its neck and abdomen. Its most defining feature is its head, which takes the form of a pair of sirens, each with a mouth inside.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>ShadowBorne</h2><div class="hey"><img src="shadow.webp" class="picture"><p>Shadowborne was an upcoming monster in Pillar Chase 2. Initially teased November 25, 2024, Shadowborne is an Alternative Universe take of Theodore Peterson from the Hello Neighbor series, heavily based on the story of the early alpha builds of the first Hello Neighbor game that heavily portrayed Theodore Peterson as a satanic entity, as well as being based on the overarching antagonists of the Hello Neighbor series, The Thing and The Guest. He was scrapped due to Tronus leaving the Development Team, and will instead make an appearance in his own series; "Light Into Darkness". Shadowborne takes the appearance of Theodore Peterson, with some altercations. He dons a feather-like cape, as well as having a belt with pouches around it. Instead of regular shoes, Shadowborne has boots. A shadow covers half of his face, erupting like polygonal flames. His hair, brows and mustache are black and grown out, and he now sports a goatee. He lacks the usual diamond-like pattern on his shirt, instead opting for a Houndstooth pattern. He also wields a Trident, which serves as his second form of attack. The Trident itself is made out of a dark red color with a hexagonal material, with the prongs glowing a bright yellow color, and sparks flying out of said prongs, and a glowing green Gem above the base of the Trident's head.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>The Lamb</h2><div class="hey"><img src="lamb.webp" class="picture"><p>The Lamb is/was an upcoming monster to Pillar Chase 2. It is an original werewolf monster based on the phrase "wolf in sheep's clothing". He was scrapped due to Froggy not knowing what to do with him. A unknown monster was made for his replacement. The Lamb appears to be a feral werewolf, with the mangled body of a bloodied lamb draped across its back. The main creature stands on two legs, its form heavily muscular and covered in rough, dark, almost stone-like skin. Its posture is slightly hunched, with long, powerful arms ending in razor-sharp claws. The Lamb's face is twisted and grotesque, with a wide, gaping mouth full of jagged teeth, permanently locked in a savage snarl.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>The Witch</h2><div class="hey"><img src="witch.webp" class="picture"><p>The Witch is a scrapped monster for Pillar Chase 2. It is a female, sorrowful zombie that has the tendency to go berserk when startled. It is one of many different zombie types featured in the horror FPS franchise Left 4 Dead, and is typically regarded as one of the most, if not the most dangerous infected in that franchise. The Witch appears to be a woman with pale gray skin and light blond hair. It has blood on its legs and long black and red claws at the end of its fingers. It also seems to have no pupils, but the same eye color as its hair.</p></div></div>
    <div class="hi"><h2>Grunt</h2><div class="hey"><img src="grunt.webp" class="picture"><p>The Servant Grunt is a scrapped Monster for Pillar Chase 2. It is a revolting, zombie-like being that is incapable of speech and appears to be in great pain. It is one of the common enemy types from the horror game Amnesia: The Dark Descent, known as the "Gatherers", sharing origins with the Stephano Item featured in both games. The Servant Grunt is a humanoid monster bearing a woven-together appearance, with beige skin and stitches and scars all over its body and dark brown boots. Its head is hideously malformed, with large, bulging eyes, a distended, boneless jaw that hangs over its torso, stretched to an absurd length, clumps of hair still attached to its head, and the nose being missing entirely. Its left hand is swollen with long, black and clawed fingers, while its other arm is more an average size.</p></div></div>
